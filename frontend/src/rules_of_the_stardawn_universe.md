# Consider this, a sort of gameplay mechanic checklist

1. The Universe can only hold so much information. It will begin to forget it's creations once it has met it's limits

2. Most creations have a Place in the Universe, an point within it that the entity is tied to

3. The Universe was never boundless. Any of it's creations outside it's horizons will be forgotten
