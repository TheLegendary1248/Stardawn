these are mostly notes to myself and future code onlookers

# why matter.js?

i have acknowlegded that it lacks:
- primitive circles
- determinism

but it's main advantages are:
- smallest js library i could find
- well documented

i've prioritized it's small size and comparable performance
i also wish to possibly add primitve circles to it's code

# why canvas api's
I love the minimalist appeal of abstract shapes, and wanted a limitation to work with
Also slightly inspired by n-gon
And it would also reduce the code base size
